# Diffusion-based Architectures for Robotic Grasping

In this repository, we implement 2 Diffusion (DDPM) models for the purpose of robotic grasping.
The first training script uses the Acronym Dataset. The second training script uses the CONG Dataset.

## Model Architecture

![example](docs/model_arch.png)

## Unconstrained Model

Dataset used for Grasps - [Acronym Dataset](https://github.com/NVlabs/acronym) <br />
Dataset for Meshes - [ShapeNetSem meshes](https://shapenet.org/) <br />
Code to preprocess the acronym dataset is in `utils/converted.ipynb`

### Overfitting 

Before we train the model on the entire dataset, we overfit a diffusion model on all grasps of one object.<br /> 
The code for this is in `overfit_1_object.ipynb`

### Training

See `train_unconstrained_model.py`

### Visualizing Grasps generated by Model

See `visualize_unconstrained_model.ipynb`

### Link for the unconstrained model file -

## Constrained Model

Dataset used for Constrained Grasps - [CONG Dataset](https://github.com/jsll/CONG/tree/main) <br />
The main [zipfile](https://huggingface.co/datasets/jens-lundell/cong) is also available on HuggingFace

### Dataset Preprocessing

Code to preprocess the CONG dataset - `utils/prepare_constrained_dataset.ipynb`<br />
You can check if the preprocessing has been correctly by visualizing the mask - `utils/visualize_constrained_data.ipynb`

### Training

See `train_constrained_model.py`

### Visualizing Constrained Grasps generated by Model

See `visualize_constrained_model.ipynb`

## Evaluation

We use PyBullet for our model evaluation
